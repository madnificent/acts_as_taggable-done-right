TagsDoneRight
=============

TagsDoneRight is an acts_as_taggable plugin, that puts the tags in a separate database.  This approach allows you to have a proper database schema, with minimal effort to allow tagging.


Example
=======

First install TagsDoneRight, please ensure the install-script is called.

As an example, we'll create a system to store books, and allow tags to be placed on them.

  script/generate scaffold book name:string comment:text
  script/generate tagsupport book

Now you can use the methods book.tag_names=( string, separator ) to set new tags (tags are parsed through the separator and the individual fields are trimmed.  You can use book.tag_names to get a string containing all the tag-names.  This means you can use book.tag_names in forms for the book, which will transparantly handle the tags.


Support for useful tagging features is coming sometime later (tag clouds etc).
